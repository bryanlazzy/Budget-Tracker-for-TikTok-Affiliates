2. In the Project Explorer pane on the left, find your **Module1**.
3. Right-click on **Module1** and select **Export File...**.
4. Save the file as `Module1.bas` inside the `src` folder of your project.

The content of this file will be the code you provided, which is correctly formatted for a `.bas` file. You should also ensure the `Excel_VBA_Budget_Tracker.xlsm` file itself is committed to the repository so users can download and start using it immediately.
