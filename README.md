# TikTok Affiliate Budget Tracker

This repository contains the VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) source code for an Excel-based budget tracker. The tool is designed to help TikTok affiliates manage and track their daily, monthly, and yearly income and expenses with automated calculations and visual aids.

Since this repository only contains the raw VBA code, you will need to import it into your own Excel workbook to use the functionality.
